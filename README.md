Curve Platform's Trading Dynamics and Comparative Network Performance

Executive Summary
The examination of Curve's platform has provided valuable insights into its trading dynamics. The platform records 6.5 million Swap transactions involving 776,000 users, accumulating a total Swap Volume of $13 billion. Despite the significant transactional activity, most users conduct fewer than 5 transactions, hinting at specific or occasional trading patterns. The platform exhibits a stable user base with the prevalence of stablecoins like USDC and USDT underlining their significance within Curve's ecosystem.
Moreover, the majority of users are categorized as "Whales," exerting substantial influence on trading volumes. User retention remains relatively stable, with a noteworthy monthly transaction peak in November 2022 amid a general declining trend over time.
In a comparative analysis across networks, Polygon leads in transaction volume and user count, while Arbitrum stands out for hosting the highest trading volumes on Curve. Avalanche demonstrates the highest average swap volume and user engagement per transaction. However, the common behavior observed across networks reveals that most users conduct fewer than 5 transactions.
While Polygon initially dominated, recent data signifies a shift in network preference, with other networks gaining momentum. Arbitrum consistently displays higher monthly swap volumes, attracting traders seeking increased transaction volumes.
